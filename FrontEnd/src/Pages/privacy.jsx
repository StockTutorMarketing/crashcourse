We may occasionally contact you using the Information to deliver the Services, critical information, necessary notices, and marketing incentives.

As long as the login/access credentials match yours, we won't make a distinction as to who is utilizing the device to access the application, website services, or products. It is crucial that you have logged in using your credentials to get the most out of the application/website/services/products and to allow your information to be appropriately captured there. You will always have the choice whether to give us sensitive personal information or other personal information that we request from you. Additionally, you will always have the choice to revoke any prior permission you gave us to use your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information while using the Application, Services, or Products.
